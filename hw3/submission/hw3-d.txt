From my so far limited experience, I think this DBMS on a cloud server has many advantages for those looking to quickly store data and 
run queries without having to pay the high initial start up costs. However, I feel that as much as it could be useful to a small business
there are many nuances a user would have to understand before investing intially. How to setup permissions in this particular environment,
seamless executing, and so on. Overall, I think a small business would need a quite savvy DB manager to make any use of it which may be infeasible
for small groups.
