/*
For each origin city, find the percentage of departing flights shorter than 3 hours. For this question, treat
flights with NULL actual_time values as longer than 3 hours. (15 points)
Name the output columns origin_city and percentage Order by percentage value. Be careful to
handle cities without any flights shorter than 3 hours. We will accept both 0 and NULL as the result for
those cities.
[Output relation cardinality: 327]

It seems that all rows that were not found in each iteration are simple elimated. I want to ideally not have that be the case.
