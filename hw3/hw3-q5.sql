/*
List all cities that cannot be reached from Seattle through a direct flight nor with one stop (i.e., with any
two flights that go through an intermediate city). Warning: this query might take a while to execute. We will
learn about how to speed this up in lecture. (15 points)
Name the output column city.
(You can assume all cities to be the collection of all origin_city or all dest_city)
(Note: Do not worry if this query takes a while to execute. We are mostly concerned with the results)
[Output relation cardinality: 3 or 4, depending on what you consider to be the set of all cities]
